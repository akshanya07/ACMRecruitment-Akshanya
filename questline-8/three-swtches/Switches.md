Switches

There are 3 switches A,B,C
We can enter only once and but check which switch controls the bulb

To find that;
    * First on switch A and leave it on for 10 mins.
    * Then off it and on switch B
    * Now enter the room and check the bulb
        - if it glows then switch B is correct,
        -if it doesnt:
            -touch it, if it is warm then switch A is correct(heating effect)
            - if its cold and not glowing,then switch B is correct.

Hence we can find the correct switch.
