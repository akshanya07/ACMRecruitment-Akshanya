EXPLANATION
According to the rules we should add numbers from 1-4 in each column,without repitition.
And solve the sudoko by completing all the missing places.

The steps i took are as follows:
1. As the number 3 is given already 3 times, we only need one more 3. And row 4 and column 4 does not contain any 3. Hence we add 3 in R4C4
2. Similarly the next number given is 1. So we fill for 1 and and 1 in rows 1 and 3. In row 1 it will be in c1 as in c4 there is already 1. Likewise we add 1 in R3C3
3. Now add 2 and 4 in r1. We do that by filling the remaining gap.
4. After we finish the 1st row, according to that fill the next 3 lines by following the rule that there should be no repetition in any row or column.
5. The sudoko is solved.
