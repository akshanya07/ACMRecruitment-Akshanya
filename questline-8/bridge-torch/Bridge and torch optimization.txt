Bridge and torch optimization

There are 4 people. Let the be A,B,C,D.
Time needed in min by:
 A=1
 B=2
 C=7
 D=10

if person A and B goes first:
        time += 2
    then A goes back:
        time += 1
    then C and D goes:
        time += 10
    then B goes back:
        time += 2
    then A and B comes back:
        time += 2
total time = 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 min

Hence total time taken is 17 min
