Debugging code

problems facing now:
       1. The limit of the smallest number is set to -9999999,hence numbers less than that is not considered. 
       2. There was no limit given to the length of the list. So even if there is only 1 number, it will try to find the smallest and it is wrong
       3. if a number repeats itself it will not be considered same and will be printed as the second largest

Solution
    1.limit the smallest and largest number to -infinity
    2. add a if statement that if the length of the list is less than 2, dont consider the list.
    3. add another if else statement so that repetition of numbers will be considered same
    4. at the end add another if else to print the resut and show DNE when there is repition or any other error
